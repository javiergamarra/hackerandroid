My past employer just hired me on contract for the few hours of support they needed me for the production launch. If your role is truly critical and you still want to help, take a few hours on the side for them, and ensure you are paid properly. Nobody ever considered me irresponsible to leave at the time I wanted to leave. If your employer runs out of money, they won\u0026#x27;t hesitate to lay you off as soon as possible, regardless of projects. That works both ways.",

          "value": "Very few public high schools in the U.S. have single-track education, at least not for \u0026quot;core\u0026quot; subjects such as English, math, and science.  There are typically remedial, standard, honors, and AP classes for these subjects.\u003Cp\u003EIf you're OK with multi-track education, it would seem like having a separate school just for gifted students is just an extension of that.\u003Cp\u003EThat said, in my own experience, although there were a lot of down sides to having some single-track subjects (e.g. physical education), one benefit of attending school with children of all ability levels was that you were exposed to children from all walks of life.\u003Cp\u003EI would imagine that a school for gifted students would have skewed socioeconomic demographics compared to a school for students of all ability levels, and in many places, that might mean less racial diversity.\u003Cp\u003EAt my public high school, we had a program where students at standard-level or above would assist special-education students.  That type of opportunity would probably be missing from a school for only gifted students.",
